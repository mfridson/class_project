### Study Methodology

The study, titled "GLP-1 Obesity Treatment without Diabetes: Clinical Outcomes and Cost Offsets," was conducted by Prime Therapeutics and analyzed data from 16 million commercially insured members. Researchers focused on members who met specific inclusion criteria:

1. Had a GLP-1 drug claim between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021
2. Maintained continuous insurance enrollment for a year before starting GLP-1 therapy and two years after
3. Had no previous GLP-1 drug claims and had a diagnosis of obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30) but no diabetes
4. Members with serious conditions like cancer or end-stage renal disease were excluded

The study compared 3,346 people with obesity (BMI > 30) who started GLP-1 therapy to 8,343 similar control subjects not using GLP-1 drugs.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Study Population
- 3,346 people with obesity (BMI > 30)
- Comparison group: 8,343 similar people not using GLP-1 drugs

#### 2. Cost Data
- Total health care costs (TCC) for GLP-1 users:
  - Before treatment: $12,695
  - Year 1: $20,165 (increase of $7,470)
  - Year 2: $18,507 (increase of $5,812 from baseline)
- TCC for control group:
  - Baseline: $11,406
  - Year 1: $11,882
  - Year 2: $13,012
- Overall cost impact: GLP-1 therapy raised yearly health care costs by approximately $7,000 in the first year and $4,200 in the second year compared to the control group

#### 3. Adherence Rates
- Only 32% of GLP-1 users remained on therapy at the end of year one
- By year two, adherence dropped to 15%
- Consistent adherence (regular use of medication) was 27% in year one
- Consistent adherence dropped to 17% in year two

#### 4. Health Outcomes
- No reduction in obesity-related medical events for GLP-1 users versus controls
- The rate of acute pancreatitis was 0.4% higher among GLP-1 users in year one
- This translates to one additional case of acute pancreatitis for every 250 GLP-1 users

### Study Conclusions

The researchers concluded that for individuals with obesity but no diabetes, GLP-1 therapy:
- Increased health care costs significantly with no observable reduction in obesity-related health issues over the two-year period
- Demonstrated poor medication persistence and adherence, with a majority of patients discontinuing therapy
- Showed a small but notable increase in risk for acute pancreatitis (0.4%)

### Implications for Coverage Decisions

Based on these findings, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas notes that their current pharmacy coverage does not include GLP-1s for weight loss (unless specifically elected by a group plan) due to:
- Significant costs without demonstrated offsets
- Low adherence rates raising questions about long-term effectiveness
- Absence of clear clinical benefits within the two-year study period

As Tiffany Liesmann, Chief Pharmacist at BCBS Kansas, stated: "As we experience new therapies that come to market at continuously rising costs, we must be good stewards of our member premium dollars that are used to pay for these therapies."

### Additional Considerations

BCBS Kansas notes that the chance of treatment success with GLP-1s is improved when used in conjunction with diet and exercise, which is included in the FDA-labeled indication for GLP-1 products. They emphasize the increased importance of meaningful lifestyle changes alongside medication use to improve the chance for any return on investment with GLP-1 therapy.
