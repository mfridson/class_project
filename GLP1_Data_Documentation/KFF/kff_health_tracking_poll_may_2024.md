# KFF Health Tracking Poll May 2024: The Public's Use and Views of GLP-1 Drugs

## Key Findings

* About one in eight adults (12%) say they have ever taken a GLP-1 agonist, including 6% who say they are currently taking such a drug.
* The share who report ever taking these drugs rises to:
  * 43% among adults with diabetes
  * 25% who have been told they have heart disease
  * 22% who have been told by a doctor that they are overweight or obese in the past five years
* Public awareness of GLP-1 drugs has increased in the past year, with about one-third (32%) of adults now saying they have heard "a lot" about these drugs, up from 19% in July 2023.
* Most adults who have taken GLP-1 drugs say they took them to treat a chronic condition including diabetes or heart disease (62%), while about four in ten say they took them primarily to lose weight.
* About half (54%) of all adults who have taken GLP-1 drugs say it was difficult to afford the cost, including one in five (22%) who say it was "very difficult."
* While most insured adults who have taken these drugs say their insurance covered at least part of the cost, even among insured adults about half (53%) say the cost was difficult to afford.
* While 8% of adults ages 65 and older say they have taken a GLP-1 medication for a chronic condition, just 1% say they have ever taken a GLP-1 drug to lose weight, which may reflect Medicare's lack of coverage for prescription drugs used for weight loss.
* Nearly four in ten (37%) adults ages 65 and older report being told by a doctor they are overweight or obese in the past five years.
* Six in ten adults say they think Medicare should cover the cost of these drugs when prescribed for weight loss for people who are overweight, including more than half of Democrats, independents and Republicans.
