### Clinical Framework Advances

#### New Obesity Definition Models
1. **Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Commission**:
   - New definition of clinical obesity
   - Algorithm to differentiate between preclinical and clinical obesity
   - Three-component approach (anthropometrical, clinical, impairment of day-to-day activities)

2. **European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO)**:
   - Updated framework for diagnosing, staging, and managing obesity
   - Defines obesity as an adiposity-based chronic disease
   - Emphasizes importance of clinical staging

#### Label Changes
- BMI ranges removed from FDA labels for Wegovy® and Zepbound®
- FDA and EMA approved updates to Wegovy® label to reflect cardiovascular risk reduction data from SELECT and STEP HFpEF trials

### Clinical Trial Results (2024-2025)

#### Semaglutide (SC)
- **FLOW Study**: 24% reduction in major kidney disease events, 18% reduction in MACE over three years
- **STEP UP Study**: 20.7% weight loss at 7.2 mg dose over 72 weeks (vs. 15.6% with 2.4 mg dose in earlier STEP-1 study)

#### Oral Semaglutide
- **OASIS 4 Study**: 25 mg dose showed 13.6% weight loss, nearly as effective as 50 mg dose (15.1%) but with better tolerability

#### Tirzepatide
- **SURMOUNT-5**: 47% greater relative weight loss compared to Wegovy® (20.2% vs. 13.7% at 72 weeks)
- **SUMMIT Study**: 38% reduced risk of heart failure outcomes, improved symptoms and physical limitations
- **SYNERGY-NASH**: Superior to placebo in resolving MASH, >50% of participants showing improvement in fibrosis at 52 weeks

#### Retatrutide
- **Phase 2 Data**: Set new benchmark with 24.2% weight loss at 48 weeks (12 mg dose)

#### Survodutide
- **Phase 2 MASH Study**: 83% of participants achieved statistically significant improvements in MASH
- Met all secondary endpoints including significant improvement in liver fibrosis

#### Pemvidutide
- **MOMENTUM Phase 2**: 15.6% weight loss at highest dose (2.4 mg) within 48 weeks
- MRI sub-study showed lean loss ratio of 21.9% (only 19.9% in subjects aged 60+)
- 28.3% reduction in visceral adipose tissue vs. 19.5% loss in subcutaneous adipose tissue

#### MariTide
- **Phase 2**: 20% weight loss at 52 weeks with no plateau observed
- Acts as GIP antagonist (unlike other dual incretin mimetics which are GIP agonists)
- Offers monthly injection convenience

#### Orforglipron
- **Phase 2**: 14.7% weight loss at 36 weeks
- Non-peptide-based incretin mimetic that doesn't require special storage
- Can be taken independently of meals (unlike oral semaglutide)

#### VK2735
- **Phase 1/2**: Up to 14.7% weight loss after 13 weeks
- Novel dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist in both oral and injectable formulations

#### CagriSema
- **REDEFINE-1 Phase 3**: 22.7% weight loss over 68 weeks
- Combination of GLP-1-RA and amylin receptor agonist

#### Amycretin
- **Phase 2**: 22% weight loss over just 36 weeks (matching CagriSema's efficacy in half the time)

#### CT-388
- **Phase 1b**: 18.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss over 24 weeks
- Signal-biased dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist with minimal β-arrestin recruitment

#### HRS9531
- **Phase 2**: 22.8% weight loss (21.1% placebo adjusted) at 36 weeks
- Favorable safety profile with mostly mild adverse events

### Anticipated Clinical Trial Results (2025+)

#### Orforglipron
- **ATTAIN-1 Phase 3**: Primary completion expected July 2025
- **ATTAIN-MAINTAIN Phase 3b**: Will evaluate Orforglipron for sustaining weight loss

#### Retatrutide

- **TRIUMPH-1 and TRIUMPH-2 Phase 3**: Enrollment complete, results expected mid-2026
- **TRIUMPH-5**: Retatrutide vs. tirzepatide comparison expected 2027
- **TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES**: Long-term outcomes expected 2029

#### Tirzepatide
- **SURPASS-CVOT**: Results on cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes expected June 2025
- **SURMOUNT-MMO**: Analyzing effects on morbidity/mortality in obesity, results expected 2027

#### CT-388
- **Phase 2**: Results expected Q1 2026

#### Survodutide
- **SYNCHRONIZE-1 Phase 3**: Completion expected December 2025
- Question: Will it show >25% weight loss over year-long maintenance therapy?

#### Pemvidutide
- **IMPACT Trial Phase 2b**: Results in MASH expected mid-2025
- **VELOCITY Phase 3**: Program for obesity and type 2 diabetes in planning stages

### Epidemiological Impact

JAMA reported that for the first time in over a decade, BMI and obesity prevalence in the U.S. decreased:
- 46% (2022) → 45.6% (2023)
- Most notable decline occurred in the South, which had the highest per capita dispensing rate of GLP-1 receptor agonists
