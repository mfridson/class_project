### Summary of Clinical Findings

- **Metabolic Effects**:
  - Significant weight reduction
  - Effective glycemic control (HbA1c reduction)
  - Does not typically cause weight gain

- **Cardiovascular Benefits**:
  - Reduction in cardiovascular events
  - Benefits appear independent of baseline medication use

- **Renal Benefits**:
  - Reduction in clinically important kidney events
  - Protection against kidney failure

- **Neurological Benefits**:
  - Reduced risk of substance use disorders
  - Reduced risk of psychotic disorders
  - Reduced risk of neurocognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease

- **Safety Profile**:
  - Most common adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature
  - Tirzepatide showed better efficacy with comparable safety to other GLP-1RAs
  - Long-term safety established in multiple studies
