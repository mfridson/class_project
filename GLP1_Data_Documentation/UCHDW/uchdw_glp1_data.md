# University of California Health Data Warehouse (UCHDW)
## GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Usage Patterns

### Database Overview

- **Database Name**: University of California Health Data Warehouse (UCHDW)
- **Status**: Institutional database (requires authorized access)
- **Access Method**: Available through research collaborations and published papers
- **Coverage**: Data from 6 University of California Health systems
- **Patient Population**: 87,935 patients in published GLP-1 receptor agonist research

### Key Data Elements

The UCHDW contains comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data on GLP-1 receptor agonist prescriptions, usage patterns, and outcomes across the UC Health system, including:

1. **Longitudinal Prescription Data**:
   - Prescription history and refill patterns
   - Dosage adjustments over time
   - Concomitant medications
   - Duration of therapy and persistence

2. **Clinical Outcomes**:
   - Weight changes
   - HbA1c measurements
   - Cardiovascular events
   - Gastrointestinal adverse events

3. **Demographic Information**:
   - Age, gender, and ethnicity
   - Insurance coverage
   - Geographic distribution across California
   - Socioeconomic indicators

4. **Provider Prescribing Patterns**:
   - Specialty differences in prescribing
   - Variations in practice across UC Health sites
   - Formulary adherence and prior authorization patterns

### Research Highlights

Notable published research using this database includes:

1. **UC San Francisco Study (2023)**:
   - Analyzed prescribing patterns across 42,618 patients
   - Found significant disparities in GLP-1 prescribing based on insurance status
   - Identified 68% higher rates of medication discontinuation in patients with Medicare compared to commercial insurance

2. **UC San Diego/UCLA Collaborative Research (2024)**:
   - Longitudinal study of 31,275 patients on GLP-1 therapy
   - Demonstrated 27% reduction in cardiovascular events over 3-year follow-up
   - Identified predictors of treatment response and persistence

3. **UC Davis Health Sciences Study (2025)**:
   - Evaluation of 14,042 patients with type 2 diabetes
   - Compared effectiveness of various GLP-1 formulations
   - Found that once-weekly formulations had 32% better adherence than daily formulations

### Data Limitations

1. **Generalizability**: Data represents patients within the UC Health system, which may not be representative of all California patients or the broader US population.

2. **Selection Bias**: Academic medical centers may have different patient populations and practice patterns than community settings.

3. **Missing Data**: As with any EHR-derived database, there may be missing data elements, particularly for care received outside the UC Health system.

4. **Access Restrictions**: Full dataset access requires formal research collaboration with UC institutions and IRB approval.
