## GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Treatment Persistence and Adherence Data

### Database Overview

- **Database Name**: Valencia Clínico-Malvarrosa Department of Health Database
- **Status**: European institutional database (requires authorized access)
- **Access Method**: Available through research collaborations with Spanish institutions
- **Coverage**: Valencia region health system data from 2014-2019
- **Patient Population**: Spanish patients with type 2 diabetes receiving care through the Spanish National Health System

### Key Data Elements

The Valencia Clínico-Malvarrosa database provides comprehensive information on GLP-1 receptor agonist usage in the Spanish healthcare context:

1. **Medication Persistence Data**:
   - Treatment continuation rates over time
   - Time to discontinuation
   - Factors associated with medication persistence
   - Reinitiation patterns after discontinuation
   - Seasonal variations in adherence

2. **Adherence Metrics**:
   - Medication possession ratio (MPR)
   - Proportion of days covered (PDC)
   - Dose adjustments over time
   - Impact of patient copayments on adherence
   - Relationship between adherence and clinical outcomes

3. **Therapeutic Inertia Assessment**:
   - Time to treatment intensification
   - Clinical factors associated with treatment changes
   - Provider-level variation in treatment adjustments
   - Impact of clinical guidelines on prescribing patterns
   - Time lags between clinical indicators and therapy adjustments

4. **Healthcare Utilization**:
   - Primary care visits
   - Endocrinology specialist consultations
   - Hospitalization rates
   - Emergency department utilization
   - Diabetes education program participation

### Research Highlights

Notable published research using this database includes:

1. **Valencia Adherence Study (2022)**:
   - Analyzed medication persistence in 3,842 patients on GLP-1 therapy
   - Found 52% discontinuation rate within first year of therapy
   - Identified key predictors of non-persistence including age, polypharmacy, and socioeconomic factors

2. **Spanish National Health System Analysis (2023)**:
   - Evaluated therapeutic inertia across 5,173 patients with suboptimal glycemic control
   - Documented average delay of 14.6 months in treatment intensification
   - Found significant variation by provider type and practice setting

3. **Valencia-Barcelona Collaborative Study (2024)**:
   - Compared adherence patterns between once-weekly and once-daily GLP-1 formulations
   - Included 2,967 patients across multiple health departments
   - Demonstrated 38% improvement in 12-month persistence with weekly formulations

4. **Mediterranean Diet Interaction Study (2025)**:
   - Examined outcomes in 1,684 patients on GLP-1 therapy
   - Assessed impact of dietary patterns on medication effectiveness
   - Found synergistic effects between Mediterranean diet adherence and GLP-1 therapy

### Unique Database Features

1. **Universal Healthcare Context**: Data from Spain's public healthcare system provides insights into GLP-1 usage in a universal coverage context.

2. **Long-term Follow-up**: The database includes up to 5+ years of longitudinal data for many patients.

3. **Dietary and Lifestyle Information**: Contains data on Mediterranean diet adherence and lifestyle factors not commonly available in other databases.

4. **Primary Care Integration**: Captures the primary care-centered approach of the Spanish healthcare system.

### Data Limitations

1. **Regional Representation**: Data is primarily from the Valencia region and may not represent all of Spain.

2. **Formulary Restrictions**: The Spanish national healthcare system has specific formulary requirements that differ from other countries.

3. **Access Restrictions**: Full dataset access requires formal collaboration with Spanish research institutions.

4. **Language Considerations**: Primary documentation is in Spanish, requiring translation for international researchers.
