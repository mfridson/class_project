## Data Collection Methods

1. **Web Scraping**: Used Bright Data MCP tools to collect web content from accessible sources
2. **Search Engine Queries**: Utilized search tools to find relevant data sources and content
3. **Data Compilation**: Manually compiled and organized data from various sources into structured documents
4. **Documentation**: Created detailed documentation for each data source with metadata
5. **Database Metadata Collection**: For institutional databases, compiled information about data structure and research highlights

## Access Limitations

Several data sources had access limitations that prevented full data collection:

1. **PubMed**: Direct access to the database was restricted; data was compiled from search results
2. **CMS**: The Innovation Center Milestones dataset required special access; information was compiled from search results
3. **FAERS**: The complete raw data files require specialized database knowledge; only metadata was collected
4. **Institutional Databases** (UCHDW, VA, Amplity, Valencia): These databases require formal institutional access; documentation was created based on published research
5. **Twitter/X API**: API access requires developer account and authentication; documentation was created on access methodology

## Next Steps

1. **Data Analysis**: The collected data can be analyzed to identify patterns and insights
2. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to better understand trends and relationships
3. **Expanded Collection**: Pursue formal access to restricted datasets for more comprehensive analysis
4. **Integration**: Combine data from different sources to create a unified view of GLP-1 receptor agonist usage and effects
5. **Cross-Database Comparison**: Compare findings across different healthcare systems (US, Spain, VA system, etc.)
6. **API Implementation**: Develop Twitter/X API data collection for real-time social media monitoring
7. **Meta-Analysis**: Conduct meta-analysis across clinical trials and real-world data sources
8. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare results from BCBS Kansas study with other real-world effectiveness studies
9. **Cost Management Evaluation**: Evaluate effectiveness of different cost management approaches outlined by Evernorth
10. **Clinical Trial Monitoring**: Track progress of upcoming clinical trials identified in the Medpace analysis
